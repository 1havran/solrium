solr 0.2.1
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Re-working package, lots of breaking changes.
* New `solr_connect()` function to establish connection with a
local or remote Solr server.
* New suite of functions for managing a Solr server, including
metadata and managing (creating/deleting/etc) on cores/collections,
adding/deleting/updating documents via json/xml/csv, and more...


solr 0.1.4
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Removed R version dependency in DESCRIPTION file, didn't seem to be a reason for it, (#25).
* Removed redundant code from multiple functions to single functions in zzz.r file.

solr 0.1.3
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Added function `solr_group()`, and started group parser, to do grouping searches.
* Fixed `solr_*` functions so that you pass in many fields as a vector e.g., (`c('field1','field')`), rather than as a comma-separated string e.g., `'field1,field'` (#22).
* Added a message to each `solr_*` function to print HTTP uri. Can be suppressed with `verbose=FALSE`.
* Started `solr_all` function to try to integrate all things into one function, as everthing is just parameters passed to the same URL - we'll see how useful though.

solr 0.1.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* released to CRAN
